							</li>
							<li>Promotion of social connectivity and diversity.</li>
						</ul>
						<br />
						<p>
							In pursuing this holistic strategy, we also recognize that dynamic
							innovation is most beneficial when coupled with deliberate
							conservation. To that end, we regard New Jersey’s urban centers as
							important chroniclers of our shared history in addition to being
							powerful facilitators of social, economic and environmental
							progress.

							Prior to founding Melillo Equities, Mr. Melillo worked at ABM

							Mr. Melillo is an active philanthropist both within his community

							provide municipalities with the tools necessary to combat sprawl
							and rampant development of New Jersey’s priceless watersheds and
							viewsheds.

							Mr. Melillo graduated with a BS in Economics from the Wharton
